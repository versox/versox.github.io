            <h2>Carson Cass</h2>
            <p>This project aims to explore editing vertices of meshes through an immersive experience. Through the use of 6 DOF controls, the user is able to better control modelling operations by feeling where the points are in physical space. Real time manipulation of the mesh allows the user to see it change. There are also some movement techniques implemented with a focus on assisting the user more easily model.</p>

                <li>Both hands together scale the world relative to the distance between the hands</li>
                <li>Vertex handle objects are created for each vertice of the mesh. When they move, the mesh vertices are updated.</li>
